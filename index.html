    <h2>Deciding My Path</h2>
        <p>Choosing a college course was a big decision for me, and I wanted something that fit my 
            <b>passion</b>, my <strong>skills</strong>, and my future goals.  
                My interest in technology started when I was <i>young</i>, I was <em>curious</em> about gadgets and computers.  
                    I realized technology is not just about <mark>playing games</mark> but about solving problems.  
                        <small>(Even small steps matter)</small> </p>
                        <hr>

    <h3>Why BSIT Feels Right for Me</h3>
        <p>That is why I chose <b>BSIT</b>. It offers hands-on learning in programming, networking, 
            <del>boring tasks</del> <ins>exciting projects</ins>, databases, and cybersecurity.  
                I even learned that H<sub>2</sub>O = Water and X<sup>2</sup> means squared while coding math formulas.</p>
                    <hr>

    <h4>More Than Just a Job</h4>
    <p>For me, <b>BSIT</b> is not only about passion but also about practicality. IT jobs are in high demand, which means opportunities for growth and stability.<br><br>
        But beyond the career, what inspires me is the chance to make a difference through technology, whether by improving systems, creating solutions, or protecting peopleâ€™s data.</p>
    <hr>

    <h5>Ready for the Challenges Ahead</h5>
    <p>I know BSIT will challenge me, but I see challenges as opportunities to grow. I am ready to learn, collaborate, and keep improving. In the future, I hope to work in a company that values innovation and maybe even build my own tech business. More importantly, I want to keep learning because technology never stops evolving.</p>
    <hr>

    <h6>Looking Ahead</h6>
    <p>For me, BSIT is more than just a course. It is the path where my curiosity, skills, and dreams come together and where I can be part of shaping the future.</p>
